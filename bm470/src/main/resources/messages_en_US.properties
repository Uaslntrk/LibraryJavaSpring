#************************ History Page ************************

history.title=Our History
history.tab1.title=How We Started
history.tab1.content=Our Public Library was founded in 1960 as a small reading room. It became a cornerstone for transmitting the environmental factors of that era. In its early years, our library served only with printed books and manuscripts, but with the intense interest of the local community, it grew rapidly. Since the 1980s, with cultural and artistic events, author meetings, workshops, and seminars, it has played an important role in the intellectual and cultural life of the people. With the rapid advancement of technology, our library has evolved into digital archives, e-book platforms, and interactive learning tools. Today, as a modern public library built with both printed and digital resources, we continue to carry the changes from the past into the future. The history of our library stands out as a structure that successfully blends the pace and innovations of the era.
